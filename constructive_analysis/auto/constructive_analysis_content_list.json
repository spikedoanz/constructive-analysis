The approach here, due to Gabriel Stolzenberg, is via intervals of rational numbers and the arithmetic of such intervals. The many elementary theorems about the properties of this arithmetic later reappear as properties of the real numbers,and verifying them provides a gentle introduction to the art and practice of devising and writing readable and correct proofs. Furthermore, there is a useful metaphor: a rational interval is exactly what is obtained when a scientist uses instruments of limited (but known） accuracy to measure something. Families of rational intervals then correspond to multiple measurements,and the condition on a family that any two of its intervals must meet establishes the consistency of its measurements. Finally,a real number is defined to be a family of rational intervals that is consistent in this sense,and that contains intervals of arbitrarily small length. Interval arithmetic,carried over to families of intervals,now becomes real arithmetic, and conditions on the lengths of intervals become the properties of approximation of reals by rationals. ",

One important example is the traditional Law of Trichotomy, namely that precisely one of $x < y$ ， $y < x$ ，or $x = y$ must hold. This property holds for the rationals,since rational arithmetic is basically integer arithmetic. However, reals can, in general, only be approximated by rationals. Modern computer algebra systems allow the user to specify a tolerance,which is expressed as the number of decimal places. This number can be chosen as large as one pleases,but not infinitely large.The corresponding tolerance， say $\\epsilon$ , tells us how closely we can distinguish reals using the computer's rational representation. These considerations lead to the formulation of real number comparison that we prove and use throughout the book. ",

I found Gabe's approach so elegant, and the material so appealing pedagogically, that I signed up to teach the analysis course, which had just become required for our majors. Over the years,with his help and encouragement,I worked this material into a text suited to the particular mix of students who take this course here at Northeastern.Many of the mathematical ideas in the current form of this text were adapted directly from Gabe's notes,especially the following:all of the material on the construction of the reals via rational interval arithmetic, the Inverse Function Theorem and its beautiful proof, the properties of exponential functions,and the creation of the Riemann integral. The use of the uniform notions of continuity and differentiability were also part of the “constructive mindset” that Gabe introduced me to and which I have tried to employ throughout the remainder of the book. As a mathematician specializing in homological algebra, working with this new perspective was like writing a second thesis,with Gabe as advisor and friend. ",

        "text": "The natural numbers 1, 2,3... are used for counting discrete objects. In fact, the idea of counting is based on an assumption of discreteness. If a quantity to be measured is not a whole number of the units used to measure it, then the unit is subdivided into smaller units (yards into feet into inches into tenth inches etc.) and combinations of units are used (e.g. 2 feet 10 inches plus 3 tenth-inches).It is unclear when the idea that a single number could represent such a measurement was first thought of,although the Babylonians,with their uniquely advanced positional notation,may have achieved this realization. If one magnitude $M _ { 1 }$ was used to measure another $M _ { 2 }$ and the first didn't go into the second evenly, the school of Euclid referred to the relationship not as a number but as a ratio (this term itself being undefined). If a common unit could be chosen that measured each magnitude evenly, say $M _ { 1 } = a$ units and $M _ { 2 } = b$ units, then the ratio of magnitudes would be equal to a ratio of whole numbers, $M _ { 1 } : M _ { 2 } = a : b$ $M _ { 1 }$ and $M _ { 2 }$ were called commensurable in this case. Thus,a ratio of commensurables was basically an ordered pair of whole numbers,and various laws were given for dealing with them; for example, $a d : b d = a : b$ . From Renaissance times this ordered pair $a : b$ has been denoted with a slash: $a / b$ ,and we now refer to it as a fraction or rational number instead of just a ratio. Historically, these ratios of whole numbers were accepted long before even negative whole numbers were used. ",

In fact, there are infinitely many others in between $r$ and $s$ as well. However,even though the rationals are infinitely close together, given two rationals it is always possible to tell exactly which of the conditions $r \\ < \\ s$ ， $r = s$ or $r \\_ s$ holds.This is because an order relation on rationals amounts to verifying an order relation between the integers $^ { a d }$ and $c b$ ，and any two integers can be compared in a finite number of steps. The actual (practical) number of steps depends on how these integers are represented. In our base 10 positional notation, for example, two integers of roughly the same size $_ { n }$ require at most about $\\log _ { 1 0 } n$ comparisons of the digits $0 , \\ldots , 9$ , starting from the left.We summarize this computational fact in the following important result.

On the other hand, the infinite decimal representing $\\sqrt { 2 }$ ,1.414213562...,. never repeats.Although we can define the collection of reals in this way, there are problems, the biggest one being how to define the arithmetic operations. For example, in order to add two infinite decimals,we have to “start” somewhere—at some decimal place “on the right.”But then we have the problem of carries: some addition of digits to the right of where we start may require a carry that could effect the digits at or to the left of where we start.There is no simple way of dealing with this difficulty: any solution involves more and more complications.Furthermore,we lose the simplicity of rationals since even simple ones such as 3/17 involve complicated, repeating,infinite decimals.

We will not discuss these constructions here, but will use a more modern one developed by Gabriel Stolzenberg,based on“interval arithmetic.\" There are several advantages to this approach. The first is that we deal exclusively with rational numbers and their arithmetic (so we avoid the diffculties inherent in the infinite decimals approach). Secondly, as we discuss below, intervals of rational numbers are very much like scientific measurements,which, because of the fallibility of our instruments,are actually ranges of possible values. Finally, the analogy between interval arithmetic and scientific measurement allows us to apply theoretical results from the former to produce applications to the latter in the study of errors and error propagation.

Having done this,we turn to collections or families of rational intervals (representing a sequence or set of measurements). We define similar arithmetic operations on these families and then define two important properties that a family of intervals may have. The first of these, consistency, stipulates that any two intervals in the family intersect. The second, fineness, demands that the family contain intervals of arbitrarily small length. While this is seldom realizable in the real world, such a family can arise mathematically by taking partial sums of approximating series or other convergent numerical procedures. In fact, we will eventually define convergence using this idea. ",

Finally, we end by proving the central property that distinguishes the reals from the rationals: completeness. This takes the form of proving that any fine and consistent family of real intervals contains a unique real number common to all the intervals. Applications of completeness will be found throughout the following chapters,especially in the constructions of $_ { n }$ th roots,exponential functions and logs, limits of series and functions,and the Riemann integral.

Thus,the left-hand endpoints of intervals in the family $A$ are really lower bounds for $A$ ,and the right-hand endpoints are upper bounds. Conversely, suppose that $\\lfloor r , s \\rfloor$ is a rational interval with endpoints $r$ and $s$ satisfying this inequality. Then $\\lfloor r , s \\rfloor$ intersects every interval in $A$ by the same proposition.

We can continue enlarging $A$ in this way to form $A ^ { * }$ , the family of all rational intervals which meet every interval of $A$ .By Corollary 1.3.14 we know that $A ^ { * }$ is consistent,and it is also fine since it contains $A$ (which is fine).

So, for example,we may talk about the arithmetic of numbers,the arithmetic of vectors or the arithmetic of matrices. In this chapter we will see that the arithmetic of real numbers is very similar to that of the rationals in the sense that similar laws hold (e.g. associativity, commutativity, etc.） This is not too surprising, since the reals inherit their basic arithmetic (a-rith-met $'$ -ic)operations from those defined on families of rational intervals.The arithmetic of rational intervals,as we have already seen, is derived from that of the rationals. There are some differences,however,mostly stemming from that fact that we can always tell when a rational has a reciprocal since we can always tell when a rational is “not zero.”This is not true for reals,where,in order to find the reciprocal of $A$ we have to determine,explicitly, that $A > 0$ or $A < 0$ ,that is,whether $A \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { * }$ .Except in certain specific examples,this requires proving a theorem (see the appendix to this chapter on “The Goldbach Number\").

Put another way, the equation $x ^ { 3 } = 2$ had no solution when all we had was the rationals, but we now can construct a solution that is a real number. Thinking of a rational interval, as we have done before,as a measurement,one might be tempted to say that this real number is “the collection of all attempts to measure a cube root of 2 with rationals.” Technically this is circular, since the cube root of 2 was not actually a “thing” that could be “measured,”when all we had was the rationals; nevertheless,it describes the process of construction rather nicely.

Well, we could have done something fancy, like notating real intervals with double brackets: $\\left\\lfloor \\left\\lfloor 1 / 2 , 3 / 4 \\right\\rfloor \\right\\rfloor$ .But instead we will simply assume that from now on, all intervals $[ a , b ]$ are real intervals unless otherwise specifed.

The right-hand condition guarantees that this family is also fine; hence we can invoke the Completeness Theorem to find some $_ { x }$ which is in all of them. It will turn out that $f ( x ) = z$ ",

In general, though,we will have to make some sort of assumptions to guarantee that,for each allowable real number $z$ lying in some interval,we can find an $_ { x }$ in the domain of $f$ such that $f ( x ) = z$ ； furthermore,we want to avoid the possibility that there might be more than one such $_ { x }$ ，since that will complicate our task of finding the right one. So,it will be useful to make sure that $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } )$ implies that $x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 }$ ． Also,for reasons that will become clear when you see how the construction unfolds,we want $f ( x _ { 1 } )$ and $f ( x _ { 2 } )$ to be close when $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ are close.

Start with the interval $\\left\\lfloor a _ { 0 } , b _ { 0 } \\right\\rfloor \\ = \\ \\left\\lfloor A , B \\right\\rfloor$ and construct a sequence of nested intervals $\\left\\lfloor a _ { 0 } , b _ { 0 } \\right\\rfloor \\supset \\cdots \\supset \\left\\lfloor a _ { k - 1 } , b _ { k - 1 } \\right\\rfloor \\supset \\left\\lfloor a _ { k } , b _ { k } \\right\\rfloor \\supset \\cdots$ ，with $f ( a _ { k } ) \\leq z \\leq f ( b _ { k } )$ We would construct these recursively, that is,using the one already found to find the next. So suppose that $\\left\\lfloor a _ { k } , b _ { k } \\right\\rfloor$ has been defined with $z$ lying between $f ( a _ { k } )$ and $f ( b _ { k } )$ Let $_ { m }$ be its midpoint (i.e. $m = ( a _ { k } + b _ { k } ) / 2 )$ ，and look at $f ( m )$ If $z \\leq f ( m )$ ， then $f ( a _ { k } ) \\leq z \\leq f ( m )$ ，s0 $f ^ { - 1 } ( z )$ would lie between $a _ { k }$ and $_ { m }$ (we are assuming $f$ is increasing;i.e.if $x \\ \\leq \\ y$ then $f \\left( x \\right) \\leq f \\left( y \\right) \\rangle$ .In this case,we would choose the next interval $[ a _ { k + 1 } , b _ { k + 1 } ]$ to be $\\lfloor a _ { k } , m \\rfloor$ . On the other hand, if $f ( m ) \\leq z$ ，then $f ( m ) \\leq z \\leq f ( b _ { k } )$ ， so we would choose $\\left\\lfloor a _ { k + 1 } , b _ { k + 1 } \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor m , b _ { k } \\right\\rfloor$ . Each of the intervals $\\lfloor a _ { k } , m \\rfloor$ ， $[ m , b _ { k } ]$ have half the length of $\\left[ a _ { k } , b _ { k } \\right]$ . Repeating this process yields a nested (hence consistent） family of real intervals,each one-half the length of the previous one. By the Completeness Theorem, this family would have a limit which we call $g ( z )$ , our candidate for $f ^ { - 1 } ( z )$ ",

You can see this easily by letting $x = 0$ in such a relation and noting that ${ \\sqrt { y } } / y$ can't be bounded by any $K$ on an interval $| 0 , B |$ ．Thus,we have to modify the statement of the IFT and its proof, slightly, to deal with intervals containing 0. We will state the results here,but leave their proofs as exercises. ",

However, the algorithm for doing so may force $s$ (and hence $r$ ）to be large.But since the intersection of any two intervals in $x ^ { * }$ is also in $x ^ { * }$ ，we can restrict ourselves to subintervals of a fixed constant interval, as we did at the end of the proof.

As you will notice, the argument is almost exactly the same as the one we gave for Cauchy Completeness (Theorem 3.1.14). For each $\\epsilon > 0$ and $u > A ( \\epsilon )$ ,we form the real interval $\\lvert F ( u ) - \\epsilon , F ( u ) + \\epsilon \\rvert$ .Let $\\mathcal { F }$ be the family of all such intervals for all $\\epsilon > 0$ Since, for any $\\epsilon > 0$ we can find an $A ( \\epsilon )$ ， $\\mathcal { F }$ is fine. To prove consistancy, we must show that $F ( u ) - \\epsilon _ { 1 } \\leq F ( v ) + \\epsilon _ { 2 }$ and $F ( v ) - \\epsilon _ { 2 } \\leq F ( u ) + \\epsilon _ { 1 }$ ，where $u > A ( \\epsilon _ { 1 } )$ and $v > A ( \\epsilon _ { 2 } )$ . As usual by our ruling out argument (see 1.5.33),it suffices to assume $A ( \\epsilon _ { 1 } ) \\leq A ( \\epsilon _ { 2 } )$ .Then $u , v > A ( \\epsilon _ { 1 } )$ s0 $F ( u )$ and $F \\left( v \\right)$ are within $\\epsilon _ { 1 }$ ； consequently $F ( v ) - \\epsilon _ { 1 } \\leq F ( u ) \\leq F ( v ) + \\epsilon _ { 1 }$ . The left-hand inequality gives $F ( v ) - \\epsilon _ { 2 } < F ( v ) \\leq$ $F ( u ) + \\epsilon _ { 1 }$ , while the right-hand inequality gives $F ( u ) - \\epsilon _ { 1 } \\le F ( v ) < F ( v ) + \\epsilon _ { 2 }$ .We let $L$ be the limit of this family.

The advantage of this approach is that you easily get Lipschitz conditions and differentiability from the the Law of Bounded Change and the Fundamental Theorem. One also gets the properties of log and exponential functions by a clever interplay of the properties of this particular integral and the fact that any two antiderivatives of the same function differ by a constant.

Theorems like Abel's,which assert that convergent series are summable in these other senses,and sum to what they converge to, are now usually called Abelian theorems. Converses (more properly, partial converses)，which state that under certain conditions summability implies convergence,are called Tauberian theorems. For a brief review of some of the literature, see [Borwein, 2005]. ",

When we add on more and more terms of the Fourier series, these horns decrease in width but not in height, which persists in “overshooting” the value of the function near the jump by about $1 8 \\%$ . Thus, the Gibbs phenomenon prevents the Fourier series from converging uniformly. Here is a picture with 15 terms of the Fourier series: ",

Functions that have a Taylor series must be infinitely differentiable at $c$ ,and the convergence of the Taylor series (when it converges to $f$ ) is much better the closer $_ { x }$ is to $c$ ,as you can see from the presence of $( x - c ) ^ { n + 1 }$ in the expression for the remainder (see Theorem 7.4.8).

Thus, the Fourier series depends on the values of the function not at a single point,but over an entire interval. From Carleson's very difficult theorem,we know that the Fourier series of a continuous function converges almost everywhere,but even from the more elementary results in this book,we see that the Fourier series determines the function (it is a limit of convolutions) and that we get convergence with just the assumption of uniform differentiability.

One way around this is to allow non-integer, even irrational, frequencies in the trigonometric functions $\\sin \\alpha t$ . When this is the case,it doesn't make sense to expand the function as a series; instead, we think of the assignment of Fourier coefficients itself as a representation of the function.

This leads to an important and unique feature of this book: All existence proofs are direct, so showing that the numbers or functions in question exist means exactly that they can be explicitly calculated. For example,at the very beginning, the real numbers are shown to exist because they are constructed from the rationals using interval arithmetic. This approach, with its clear analogy to scientific measurement with tolerances,is taken throughout the book and makes the subject especially relevant and appealing to students with an interest in computing, applied mathematics, the sciences, and engineering.

The second part contains enough more technical material-including an introduction to complex variables and Fourier series-to fill out a full-year course. Throughout the book the emphasis on rigorous and direct proofs is supported by an abundance of examples，exercises,and projects-many with hints-at the end of every section. The exposition is informal but exceptionally clear and well motivated throughout. ",
